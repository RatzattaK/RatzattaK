# Hi, my name is Temmie üçï

I'm an independent programmer from Belarus. Currently I'm learning to code and most of my applications are not public because they serve no purpose for anyone other than me.

## Things that I've already made
 - Basic console application for working with databases
 - Different website layouts
 - A [Discord](https://discord.com) bot for moderating communities in Russian
 - OpenGL based Clicker game using [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net)

Once I'm confident enough in some of my WIPs, they're going to become public (like this Discord bot mentioned above). So stay tuned *I guess*.

# Hi, my name is Temmie üçï

Independent programmer, artist and contentmaker. Most of my repos are not public because they serve no purpose for anyone other than me.

## Things that I've already made
[redacted]

Once I'm confident enough in some of my WIPs, they might become public. So stay tuned *I guess*.
